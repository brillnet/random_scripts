Memory Palace - Sink, Mirror, Toilet, Shower, Towel Hanger

At the sink, the AP robot is washing its hands, but it's constantly stepping from one rug to another right beneath it—each rug marked with a different AP name, but all connected to the same subnet.
As it steps, nothing else changes—no disruption, no new IP address. A big sign on the faucet reads:


The mirror becomes a portal to a different bathroom, and every time the AP robot steps into it, it finds itself in a completely different subnet—with a glowing new IP address popping up above its head.
A "mobility anchor" device floats above the mirror like a guardian, holding a clipboard that tracks the robot’s identity so it can still get packets from the original network.


The toilet is now labeled “Mobility Group HQ”, and around it are rubber duck AP robots, each wearing matching team jerseys that say "Group A".
Whenever one duck leaves and another enters, they give each other secret handshakes, showing they trust each other and can exchange client state info.

The shower becomes a WiFi signal chamber, with a single AP mounted on the wall shooting a weak laser to a rubber duck on the drain.
The AP says, “I know it’s nearby, but I can’t tell where exactly.”
Then suddenly, two more APs appear around the tub, triangulating the duck's location like GPS satellites. The duck yells:

Hanging on each towel is a unique RF signature print, like a heat map. The AP robot walks by scanning them with a radio magnifying glass, comparing the real-time signal map to a stored digital fingerprint of the environment.

Recap
Sink	Layer 2 Roaming	Stepping between rugs, same water = same subnet
Mirror	Layer 3 Roaming	Mirror portal to new subnet, tracked by anchor
Toilet	Mobility Groups	Rubber duck APs in matching jerseys, exchanging handshakes
Shower	Locate via RSS (1 vs. 3 APs)	One AP = vague signal, 3 APs = precise triangulation
Towel Hanger	RF Fingerprinting	Each towel = unique RF signature; robot scans to find a match

Authenticating Wireless Clients

Memory Palace - Door way, TV, Bed,

Authenticating with pre-shared keys
The doorway to the room has three glowing locks stacked vertically on the door frame:

    A bronze lock labeled “WPA”
    A silver lock labeled “WPA2”
    A gold lock labeled “WPA3”

Beside each lock is a split button, labeled:
    🔑 PSK
    🧠 802.1X

The AP robot chooses the PSK path first—it types a passphrase on a glowing keypad. The door opens—but just then, a shadowy hacker figure behind a bush points a big antenna dish labeled “Handshake Sniffer” at the doorway.

He gleefully collects a glowing WPA2 handshake token from the air and tosses it into a password cracker machine that spits out the original PSK. A warning sign appears:
    “⚠️ WPA/WPA2 PSK handshake can be captured and cracked!”

Then the AP tries the WPA3 PSK lock. It enters the passphrase—but this time, the handshake explodes into confetti when the hacker tries to grab it.

The hacker yells:
    “Wha—? It’s encrypted! I can’t crack this!”
A banner unfurls over the doorway:
    “WPA3: Forward Secrecy. Safer Handshakes.”

EAP Authentication
	The TV screen is playing a flashy game show called “Who Wants to Be Authenticated?”

On stage:
    A nervous client laptop wearing a name tag: “Supplicant”
    A tall, shiny AP robot in a suit stands next to it with a tag: “Authenticator”
    And behind a glowing podium is a stern RADIUS server, wearing glasses and labeled: “Authentication Server”

The host (Authenticator) speaks into the mic:
    “Okay Supplicant, to access the network, you'll need to prove who you are!”
The Supplicant answers identity questions, which the Authenticator relays to the Authentication Server behind the scenes.

As the answers go back and forth, the screen flashes big glowing arrows labeled:

    “EAP Request → Identity”
    “EAP Response → Identity”
    “Access-Accept!”

Four Way EAPOL Handshake
 The Four Steps (visualized as moves):

    AP sends ANonce
    → The AP throws a glowing challenge orb (ANonce) across the ring.

    Client responds with SNonce + MIC
    → The client catches it and returns a blue orb (SNonce) and a handshake signature (MIC)—like a dance spin.

    AP sends GTK + confirmation MIC
    → The AP opens a treasure chest with the Group Temporal Key (GTK) and tosses it to the client with another signature stamp.

    Client sends final ACK
    → The client bows deeply in acknowledgment and fires a laser beam labeled “Install Keys” into the air.

Memory Palace - Doorway, Washer, Dryer, Shelves, Garbage Can, Garage Door

Doorway
RF range = shimmering field at the doorway
Association = clipboard and polite request
Authentication = ID badge scanned by AP
IP address assignment = glowing envelope from a DHCP mailbox

Washer
Washer = investigation station
WLC as detective robot = controller doing active search
Magnifying glass with MAC = literal MAC address target
Bubble icons = key client info: SSID, AP, IP, signal, auth

Dryer
The dryer door is now a round radar screen, spinning and pulsing with radio waves. On top of the dryer stands the WLC robot, dressed like an air traffic controller, wearing a headset and staring at a glowing dashboard clipboard titled:
    📋 “AP Radio Summary – Status Report”

On the screen are two dials labeled:
    2.4 GHz 🔵 — “Channel 6, Power Level 3, Clients: 7”
    5 GHz 🔴 — “Channel 149, Power Level 1, Clients: 14”
   
Shelves
Each shelf holds a row of miniature AP figurines, each one labeled with a name tag like:

    🟢 “AP-Kitchen”
    🔵 “AP-Conference”
    🔴 “AP-Garage”

Above each AP, color-coded tags hang like luggage tags or file labels:
    📘 Policy Tag → “Corp-WPA2”
    🟡 RF Tag → “High Power / 5GHz Prefer
    
    
Garbage Can
The garbage can lid is wide open, and inside it, a Wi-Fi signal appears as a golden microphone mounted to a pole, clearly emitting crisp audio in the form of glowing Wi-Fi signal waves.

But swirling all around inside the garbage can is a chaotic mess of:
    💨 Buzzing static clouds labeled “Interference”
    📻 Noisy radio toys blaring random signals
    🔊 A shouting toddler with a megaphone yelling "BLEEP BEEP BLAAHH"

Standing beside the garbage can is a Wi-Fi technician robot with a measuring gauge, labeled:
    📊 SNR Meter: Signal Power / Noise Level

He adjusts a dial that increases the golden mic’s signal, making it shine brighter, while muting the background junk. As he dials it in, a readout flashes:
    ✅ “SNR = 30 dB – Excellent!”
    ⚠️ “SNR = 10 dB – Struggling!”

He says:
    “When signal is strong and garbage noise is low, we get clean communication. When noise rises, it’s like yelling over a blender!”
    
Garage door
A glowing Wi-Fi highway is painted across the garage door—labeled "Channel 36."
Tiny data cars are driving across it. The more cars on the road, the more congested it becomes.
    On one side, a green lane has just a few cars zipping smoothly:
        “Channel Utilization: 10% – Smooth Flow!”
    On the other side, it’s a red traffic jam, filled with blinking cars and honking AP robots:
        “Channel Utilization: 90% – Congestion Detected!”

A traffic cop robot (WLC) is holding up a sign:
    “Too much chatter! Pick a less crowded channel!”

🔊 Right Side – Transmit Power
Mounted to the door is a giant volume knob labeled “Transmit Power,” with markings from 1 (low) to 8 (high).

A glowing AP antenna above the dial is blasting waves.
    At level 2, the waves are soft and contained:
        “Low Power – Small Coverage, Low Interference”
    At level 8, the waves are massive and bouncing off all the walls—and even hitting a poor AP hiding behind a shelf:
        “High Power – More Coverage, but More Interference!”
A sign reads:
    “More isn’t always better—transmit power must be tuned!”

AP Operation

Local - Default lightweight mode. Serves wireless clients.
When not transmitting scans for rogue devcies, checks IDS
for events.

FlexConnect - Has tunnel back to WLC. Can do local switching
of client traffic.

Monitor - Does not transmit. Only receives. Checks for IDS events and rogue APs, etc.

Sniffer - Receives 802.11 traffic from other sources. Captures
traffic and forwards it to PC running network analyzer.

Rogue Detector - Detects rogue devices by correlating MAC heard
on wireless network with MAC heard on wired network. 

Bridge - Mode to link two APs together.

Flex Bridge - Enabled on mesh AP. Can do local switching
and be centrally managed by WLC.

SE-Connect - AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis.
Can analyze data for sources of interference.

Open the microwave, and inside is the AP robot reclining in a plush “DEFAULT LOCAL MODE” lounge chair. A sign on the door of the microwave reads:

    🪧 “Welcome to Local Mode: Lightweight + Default”

The robot wears a server apron, holding a tray of mini-laptops, cheerfully handing out Wi-Fi beams like snacks to them.

Then, when no laptops are near, the robot switches to surveillance mode: it slides on spy goggles, pulls out a radar dish, and says: "No clients nearby. Time to scan for rogues and check IDS events."

At the sink, the AP robot wears a plumber’s shirt labeled “FLEXCONNECT.” It's juggling two hoses: one tunnel squirts water to a distant WLC marked “HQ,” and another hose splashes water into a local pot.

The stove is cold. The AP robot sits cross-legged in meditation with headphones on, wearing a black hoodie labeled “MONITOR.”
Around it are sticky notes: “I see rogue APs. I detect intrusions.”It whispers: “I’m in Monitor mode. I only listen.”

Open the fridge, and a glowing sign reads “SNIFFER Lab.” Inside, the AP robot wears a lab coat and uses a vacuum labeled “Sniffer 802.11 Capture Unit.”
It sucks in Wi-Fi packets, labels them, and tubes them to a laptop marked “Analyzer.”

The garbage can is now a high-tech device labeled “ROGUE DETECTOR 3000.” The AP robot tosses in a device, and a red alert pops up:

Tthe AP robot is dressed like a construction worker, wearing a yellow hard hat labeled “BRIDGE MODE”.
He’s shouting across the yard to another AP robot visible through the window in the next building. They’re working together to build a glowing, floating rope bridge of radio waves that spans between their rooftops, right through the window frame.
As they tighten the final cable, the first AP says,
    “Let’s link up wirelessly—Bridge Mode online!”

Above Window 2, an acrobatic mesh AP robot perched on the windowsill, wearing a flexible bodysuit labeled “FLEXBRIDGE MODE.”
It’s spinning a glowing rope net from the window to a faraway rooftop AP—this is its mesh link. But at the same time, it’s also plugged into a nearby smart toaster on the kitchen counter, using a glowing LAN cable to provide local switching.
Above the window, a giant floating drone WLC watches over everything from above, sending down wireless command beams like puppet strings. The AP says:
    “I’m in FlexBridge mode: connected up, switched local, and still obeying HQ!”


On the kitchen counter, the AP robot stands wearing a white lab coat with “SE-CONNECT” stitched on the back. The entire counter has transformed into a high-tech laboratory, glowing with purple and blue waveforms that ripple across the surface.
The robot waves a triangular spectro-analyzer wand over the counter. Suddenly, it freezes, points at a smoky red distortion, and says:
    “Interference detected—Bluetooth microwave spill at 2.4 GHz!”


Summary
Microwave – Local: Spa with “LOCAL mode” sign.
Sink – FlexConnect: Dual water flows, shirt says “FLEXCONNECT”.
Stove – Monitor: Silent listening with “MONITOR” hoodie.
Fridge – Sniffer: Vacuuming packets in “SNIFFER Lab”.
Garbage Can – Rogue Detector: High-tech trash scan “ROGUE DETECTOR 3000”.
Window 1 – Two APs build a radio wave bridge across the window.
Window 2 – AP in a bodysuit spins mesh link from window while also locally switching.
Counter – Counter is a lab. AP robot scans colorful waveforms for RF interference.

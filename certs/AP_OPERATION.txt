AP Operation

Local - Default lightweight mode. Serves wireless clients.
When not transmitting scans for rogue devcies, checks IDS
for events.

FlexConnect - Has tunnel back to WLC. Can do local switching
of client traffic.

Monitor - Does not transmit. Only receives. Checks for IDS events and rogue APs, etc.

Sniffer - Receives 802.11 traffic from other sources. Captures
traffic and forwards it to PC running network analyzer.

Rogue Detector - Detects rogue devices by correlating MAC heard
on wireless network with MAC heard on wired network. 

Bridge - Mode to link two APs together.

Flex Bridge - Enabled on mesh AP. Can do local switching
and be centrally managed by WLC.

SE-Connect - AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis.
Can analyze data for sources of interference.

Memory Palace - Kitchen - Microwave, Sink, Stove, Refrigerator,
Garbage Can, Window 1, Window 2, Counter

Open the microwave, and inside is the AP robot reclining in a plush “DEFAULT LOCAL MODE” lounge chair. A sign on the door of the microwave reads:

    🪧 “Welcome to Local Mode: Lightweight + Default”

The robot wears a server apron, holding a tray of mini-laptops, cheerfully handing out Wi-Fi beams like snacks to them.

Then, when no laptops are near, the robot switches to surveillance mode: it slides on spy goggles, pulls out a radar dish, and says: "No clients nearby. Time to scan for rogues and check IDS events."

At the sink, the AP robot wears a plumber’s shirt labeled “FLEXCONNECT.” It's juggling two hoses: one tunnel squirts water to a distant WLC marked “HQ,” and another hose splashes water into a local pot.

The stove is cold. The AP robot sits cross-legged in meditation with headphones on, wearing a black hoodie labeled “MONITOR.”
Around it are sticky notes: “I see rogue APs. I detect intrusions.”It whispers: “I’m in Monitor mode. I only listen.”

Open the fridge, and a glowing sign reads “SNIFFER Lab.” Inside, the AP robot wears a lab coat and uses a vacuum labeled “Sniffer 802.11 Capture Unit.”
It sucks in Wi-Fi packets, labels them, and tubes them to a laptop marked “Analyzer.”

The garbage can is now a high-tech device labeled “ROGUE DETECTOR 3000.” The AP robot tosses in a device, and a red alert pops up:

The AP robot writes “BRIDGE MODE ACTIVE” in the air with laser paint. Through Window 1, two APs hold opposite ends of a glowing data bridge.
One says to the other: “In Bridge mode, we link worlds!”

Above Window 2, a glowing banner reads “FLEX BRIDGE MODE.” A mesh AP, wearing a toolbelt, swings by on a web labeled “Mesh Link” and plugs a LAN cable into a switch labeled “Local.”

On the counter, there's a glowing console labeled “SE-CONNECT Spectrum Station.” The AP robot wears a lab coat with “SE-Connect” on the back and waves a wand over the surface as waveforms rise.

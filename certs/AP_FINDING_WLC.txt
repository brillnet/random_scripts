How can an AP find WLC and what is a Isotropic Antenna.

AP can send broadcast out to look.
AP can be primed with controllers.
DHCP server can supply controllers.
AP attempts to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.
If none of these are successful the AP resets itself.

The AP robot is standing on the table, holding a giant megaphone and shouting into the room, sending out glowing blue signal waves. Plates on the table fly into the air from the soundwaves.

The AP robot now peeks through the windows, and each pane has a label: “Primary,” “Secondary,” “Tertiary.” Behind each window, you see a different WLC robot waving back.

On the small table sits a DHCP vending machine spitting out controller IP addresses on receipts. The AP robot grabs one like it's buying a snack.

The AP robot climbs on the bed and opens a giant glowing book titled ‘DNS’. It waves a wand over the words "CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER", casting a magical blue beam toward the ceiling.

On this table sits a giant red button labeled RESET. The AP robot slaps it in frustration and folds into a cube, tucking itself into a drawer.

Open the closet doors and there is a tropical climate and robotic antenna mounted on a sleek silver pole. The antenna is perfectly tiny and floating at the center of the closet, suspended in mid-air like a museum display.

Attached to it is a basketball, not for decoration, but actually glowing and pulsing. The antenna is the source—transmitting energy into the basketball, which then emits glowing spherical waves.
